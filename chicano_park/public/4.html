    <p class="description">The Chicano Park Historical Documentation Project is being undertaken at a very
            crucial time in the history of Chicano Park and the community of Barrio Logan. After Many long months of
            negotiating with the State Department of Transportation (CalTrans), numerous participants in the negotiation
            process are still somewhat concerned over the final outcome. CalTrans has devised an alternative method of
            retrofitting the San Diego Coronado Bay Bridge for seismic safety, and officials say there will be minimal
            impact to the murals. However, we will not know exactly what type of impact this enormous project will have
            on the body of murals in Chicano Park, until completion of the retrofit.<br> Though many residents of
            Barrio Logan, Chicano Park artists, scholars, community activists, and others consider the CalTrans decision
            a victory of sorts, they are proceeding with caution. Chicano Park houses the largest collection of Chicano
            murals anywhere in the world. The value of such a body of work has been notoriously overlooked and
            down-played for decades. The pillars in Chicano Park are not merely concrete and steel supports for a
            bridge, but diligently executed works completed by numerous artists over a period of nearly three decades.
            The murals combine with the surrounding land to form a powerful art pieced that communicates not only
            ancestral history, but the long and often turbulent history of Chicano Park itself.<br> An intense sense of
            pride, support, and loyalty to Chicano Park still exists today amongst the original Chicano Park artists,
            community activists, park supporters, scholars, and the neighborhood of Barrio Logan, although many
            residents of (and visitors to) San Diego still remain unaware of the existence of the incredible murals and
            sculpture in the park. Instead they associate Chicano Park and the neighborhood of Barrio Logan with
            numerous negative connotations, primarily because of its high Latino population and lower income status. As
            a result, many people have missed out on a national treasure.<br> The Chicano Park Historical Documentation
            Project will serve as a vehicle to document and disseminate information on the art, culture, and history of
            Chicano Park to a large audience through the execution of all three phases of the project:<br> Phase I.
            Comprehensive Documentation Program<br> Phase II. Two part symposia series<br> Phase III. Traveling
            exhibition<br> We have received partial funding for Phase I, from San Diego Gas and Electric. All supporters
            will be acknowledged on all announcements, invitations, documentation, symposia and exhibition events, and
            other materials generated by this project.<br> We are currently working on organizing the symposia series.
            The symposia panels will consist of community members, artists, and humanities scholars from a multitude of
            disciplines. Together, these individuals will address the topic of Chicano Park, its significance, and the
            ways in which it compares and contrasts to the history, art, culture, and political climate of other Chicano
            communities throughout the country. Any individual wishing to participate in the project may contact
            Kathleen L. Robles at the numbers listed above.<br> One of the primary objectives of the symposia series is
            to unite humanities scholars artists, and community members from various ethnic backgrounds and levels of
            education in an atmosphere that will produce a free-flowing exchange of information, ideas, and culture. One
            of the symposiums will be held at a multi-ethnic cultural center (the Centro Cultural de la Raza), the other
            will be held at a university (SDSU). By holding the symposia in different locations, various communities
            will be brought together and symposia participants will experience an even greater multi-cultural
            exchange.<br> Together, these community members, artists, and scholars from a multitude of humanities
            disciplines will address the topic of Chicano Park, its history, art, culture, and political climate. They
            will demonstrate the significance of Chicano Park and the ways in which it compares and contrasts to the
            history, art, culture, and political climate of other Chicano communities throughout the country.<br> The 27
            year history of Chicano Park and its monumental public mural program represent a long hard struggle for the
            individuals involved. A scholarly approach and thorough documentation program will help to disperse the
            information to areas outside of San Diego County and expand the recognition of Chicano Park, its history,
            culture, and collection of Chicano murals. The Museo del Pueblo, Chicano Park Historical Project symposia
            series will provide an exciting opportunity for Californians and others to understand the importance of this
            neglected cultural resource. By involving community members and artists with humanities scholars in a public
            forum, we feel that Chicano Park and its murals will receive the national and international respect and
            understanding they so richly deserve.<br> The concept of El Museo del Pueblo originated in the 1970's as
            part of the "master plan" for Chicano Park. The plan also included a university, a mercado, and several
            other components. The idea was to create and build a museum adjacent to Chicano Park, which would house both
            permanent collections and temporary exhibitions focusing on the murals and history of Chicano Park, the
            neighborhood of Barrio Logan, and the art and culture of the Chicano / Mexican communities as a whole. The
            museum would serve as an educational enhancement and information center to all visitors. The museum is still
            in the planning stage. Funding is being sought and construction is projected to coincide with the proposed
            Mercado Project scheduled to begin later this year.<br> Nearly 26 years later, many of the original artists
            and community activists instrumental in the April 1970 takeover of the land on which Chicano Park was built
            are engaged in a heavy debate with CalTrans over the retrofit of the San Diego Coronado Bay Bridge. The main
            goal is to work collectively with CalTrans officials in an effort to devise an acceptable plan for the
            proposed retrofit. The challenge lies in finding a design that will have minimal or no impact on the Chicano
            Park Murals and park land.<br> It was decided by the community advisory committee to CalTrans and by
            countless others that a comprehensive historical and cultural documentation program must be implemented to
            assure scholarly documentation of the murals and the history of Chicano Park for future generations to
            utilize. Thus the Museo del Pueblo, Chicano Park Documentation Historical Project was initiated.
