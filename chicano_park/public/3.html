    <h5>Damaged murals would often be repaired by individual artists, with most of the
            costs coming from their own pockets. In 1986, Salvador Torres, now Chairman of the Chicano Park Arts
            Council, teamed up with Al Ducheny, Chairman of Harborview Community Council, and Guillermo Rosete of Los
            Toltecas en Aztlan, with the single goal of petitioning the Public Arts Advisory Board to recommend "the
            preservation and expansion of the Chicano Park murals" to the city. In 1987, the PAAB committee agreed to
            recognize the murals as public art, and stated that the murals were important to the culture of the
            neighborhood and the Hispanic population of San Diego, and would be an asset to the City if restored,
            maintained and expanded. Although CalTrans owned the bridge pylons upon which the murals were painted, and
            wanted to regulate non-controversial imagery of the murals (in effect, censorship), CalTrans later decided
            that mural imagery would be approved by PAAB.<br> The Chicano Park Murals were declared an Art in Public
            Places project in February 1987, with the city supplying $2,800 for the restoration of two murals. Two
            thousand dollars for two murals may have appeared as a dream to the artists involved in repairing murals
            throughout the years, but what about the other 48? Again, the necessity to organize effectively became
            apparent.<br> The Chicano Park Murals Committee was formed in 1989 as the result of such necessity. Composed
            of about twenty members representing a variety of neighborhood viewpoints, the groupâ€™s goal was to fashion a
            master plan for the park, and perhaps most importantly, find financing for it. For example, the group
            decided that the original artists would be the first choice to carry out the restoration work, followed by
            artists chosen by the original artists. After presenting the city with a well documented study of the
            procedures involved in the restoration process, the city's Commission for Arts and Culture approved a new
            donation of $60,000 to go towards restoration of the murals. Work began on the first ten murals in August
            1991. The photographs of the day were composed of Chicano artists posing and smiling with city officials: a
            very different image from that of the park takeover twenty-one years earlier.
