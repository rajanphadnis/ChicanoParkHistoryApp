    <h5>In the 1800s, the area that is now Chicano Park was known as “East End”; this was changed to Logan Heights in 1905. 
        Mexican-Americans had settled in the area as early as the 1890s, and at one point in its history, Logan Heights had contained the second largest Chicano Barrio community on the west coast. 
        During WW2, the people of Logan Heights were heavily involved in nearby naval shipyards and defense industries.
        <br> After the war, new zoning laws and construction greatly impacted the community. The Interstate 5 and the Coronado Bay Bridge were built straight through the town, dislocating many families and forcing businesses to close. 
        It was not until 1967 that residents of the area took their opinions to the government to remedy their issues, and they demanded a park be built under the newly made bridge. 
        Although the government agreed to the resident’s demands, the area for the park had barely been created even two years later. Finally, in April of 1970, bulldozers arrived to level the land. 
        However, these bulldozers were not there to create the park, but rather to prepare a site for the construction of a California Highway Patrol station. 
        Furious residents overtook the park, believing they had been deceived by city and state officials regarding the development of their park. Residents began to work the land, planting cactus, magueys, and flowers. 
        The Chicano flag was raised on a telephone pole, initiating the occupation of Chicano Park. 
        During the occupation of Chicano Park, the three-acre parcel was transformed into a desert garden of plants and grass. 
        The occupation represented the first time in which residents had come together in unity for themselves and their community. 
        <br> Eventually, on July 1, 1970, a contract was officially authorized by the city for the development of the ~1-acre parcel of land for a park. Celebrations of Chicano Park Day began in 1971 to commemorate the park takeover on April 22, 1970. 
        Chicano Park Day is a symbol of a community organization fighting to save a culture and a neighborhood and should provide a positive example to other neighborhoods within San Diego that are fighting to stay alive.
