    <h5 style='color:#ffff00;'><strong>The painting of murals in Chicano Park had been discussed as part of the park
            development since 1967. Salvador Torres, an artist and resident of Barrio Logan, is generally referred to as
            the
            architect of the dream of Chicano Park. In the early 1960s, Torres had moved to Oakland for college. After
            six
            years in Oakland, Torres returned to San Diego and Barrio Logan and witnessed the massive concrete bridge
            pylons
            piercing the heart of his community. His home had been destroyed by the construction. His initial reaction
            to
            the residential displacement was rage:<br> “Let me ask you something. How would you feel? Nobody came and
            said
            'we want to build this huge bridge on top of you. We want to annihilate you once and for all with something
            so
            big your humanity will just wither up and die” <br> Residents despised the intrusion of the bridge pylons
            while
            accepting their presence with resignation. Torres' artistic sensibility eventually overtook that of an
            indignant
            citizen, as he began to observe the bridge in a different light, as an art object providing concrete
            canvases.
            The Chicano Park Monumental Public Mural Program was therefore created by Torres in 1969. <br> In 1971,
            Torres
            traveled to Mexico City to attend the inaugural ceremonies for the Siqueiros Poly forum. The Poly forum is
            elliptical in shape, made of asbestos cement and covered with polychromed murals of relief sculpture. Torres
            was
            impressed with the similarities between the Siqueiros Polyforum and the Coronado Bay Bridge regarding form
            and
            content. Would the combination be possible in San Diego?<br> Chicano artists wanted to express their mixed
            identity as Indian/Spanish/European/American. After negotiations with city officials for approval of the
            project, in 1973, bright colors began to replace the lifeless gray concrete surfaces in Barrio Logan.<br>
            When
            the walls first became available for the community to paint on, the main focus to removing any grayness from
            the
            park. Residents took paint and spontaneously “attacked the walls” with rollers. The second mural phase began
            with a group of murals painted on Chicano Park Day in 1974, and another group from the Royal Chicano Air
            Force
            in the spring of 1975. The third phase began in 1977 in response to a growing number of junkyards in the
            area.
            During this phase, both Chicano and non Chicano artists were invited to create educational murals with
            colonial,
            pre colombian, and modern Mexican styles. <br> By 1980, large-scaled organized painting appeared to have
            lost
            its momentum. To the barrio, the murals were forgotten, and to the citizens of San Diego, they were
            relatively
            unacknowledged. However, a major step to revitalize the barrio occurred when Chicano Park was designated San
            Diego’s Historical Site #143 through the efforts of Mike Pearlman and Pat Berley, two researchers for the
            Historical Site Board.<br> The murals started gaining international attention when National Geographic
            included
            photos and articles about the murals displaying their significance and beauty. San Diego in response
            declared
            Chicano Park a historic site, ushering in a new “era” of Latino pride and culture. <br> Even still, in 1983,
            despite the murals then being internationally recognized, San Diego practically ignored Chicano Park, seeing
            it
            simply as a “passive park,” without fully acknowledging the history and impact it had on the
            community.</strong>
